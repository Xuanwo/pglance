-- pglance extension bootstrap SQL

-- Create a schema for lance-related functions if needed
-- This is optional, functions can be created in public schema

-- Example table creation function (this will be implemented later)
-- For now, we just ensure the extension loads properly

-- Add any initialization SQL here
-- For example, setting up custom types, operators, etc.

-- Currently this file is kept minimal as we're focusing on basic table scanning
-- Future versions will include:
-- - Custom vector types
-- - Lance table creation functions
-- - Indexing functions
-- - More advanced query operators
